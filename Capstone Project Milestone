Capstone Milestone Project

Problem/Business Need: 
Previously, the Thriving Ys Team was focused on strategies to help Struggling Ys. Generally, these efforts were:
·       Reactive / responding to an immediate need or crisis like a cash flow issue, a leadership vacuum, a risk issue, etc.
·       Informed by historical (often outdated) data and information that relied on context from the Resource Director(s)
Now and in the future, we intend to engage with Ys at all points in the continuum of Y vitality/health/performance and spend more time on helping Striving Ys become Thriving Ys (and/or help Thriving Ys remain Thriving Ys). The intent of this project is to create something that allows us to:
·       Use data to identify markers of a Thriving Y
·       Use data to identify where Ys are in the continuum of Struggling> Striving> Thriving, and identify what kind of engagement they need
·       Coach alliance partners and SDPYs to employ Thriving Y practices and to help Ys move the needle towards Thriving
·       Educate the movement around Thriving Y practices
·       Share with CEOs and CVOs to…
o   Understand our shared definitions and measures of Struggling, Striving, and Thriving YMCAs
o   Learn where their YMCA is on the continuum (perhaps also in relationship to other YMCAs), as informed by data rather than perception 
o   Inspire action based on where their YMCA is on the continuum (ex. share thriving strategies with others, collaborate to move along the continuum) 
In order to operate in this future state, we need:
·       A shared understanding of what a Thriving Y is (i.e., common language/metrics - within Y-USA, across the service delivery network, and across the movement - to assess and discuss the vitality/health/performance of a YMCA)
·       Consistent, clear, reliable data that…
o   Is seamlessly accessed and applied across the service delivery network
o   Is consistent with data that Ys access on their own
o   Comes alive for Ys through dashboards and visualizations
o   Reflects the past, present, and (eventually) predictive future of a Y
Client: 
Y-USA (multiple departments)
Individual YMCA associations

Describe your dataset/how you are wrangling data:
Y-USA has its own databases/warehouses on a SQL server and all data will be pulled from this resource with the exception of the “external factors” variables which will be pulled using our Esri database.  
After being pulled, it will be explored for validity reasons, cleaned, and normalized for modeling.

Initial Findings: 
As we are still in the process of working with multiple departments to determine variables, there are no findings at this time.

Code:
Though I have not yet pulled the data, the plan looks similar to this: 
For SQL pulls: 
import pyodbc 
conn = pyodbc.connect('Driver={SQL Server};'
                      'Server=server_name;'
                      'Database=db_name;'
                      'Trusted_Connection=yes;')


cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM db_name.Table')


for row in cursor:
    print(row)
For K-Means Clustering: 
from pandas import DataFrame
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
df = pd.read_csv(‘a data file, probably’)
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4).fit(df)
Labels = Kmeans.predict(df)
centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_
For Random Forest Feature Selection
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassfier
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectFromModel
X_train,y_train,X_test,y_test = train_test_split(data,test_size=0.3)
sel = SelectFromModel(RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators = 100))   #not sure about n_estimators?)
sel.fit(X_train, y_train)
selected_feat= X_train.columns[(sel.get_support())]
len(selected_feat)
print(selected_feat)
pd.series(sel.estimator_,feature_importances_,.ravel()).hist()
For Classification → we haven’t specifically spoken about which method to use for classification, tbd
